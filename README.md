# 🚀 Hugging Face Transformers Playground

This repository is my learning journey with [🤗 Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) and pipelines.
I’m exploring different NLP and speech tasks using pre-trained models, starting small and expanding step by step.

## 🔮 What’s Next?

I’ll keep expanding this repo as I dive into more Hugging Face tasks like:

* Question Answering
* Named Entity Recognition (NER)
* Summarization
* Translation
* Image + Text (multimodal models)
